%% First Steps and Function Overview
% Get in touch with grains.
%
%% Grain reconstruction from EBSD data
%
% So far grains can be exclusively computed from EBSD data using the command
% <EBSD_calcGrains.html calcGrains>. In order to demonstrate grain
% reconstruction we import some EBSD data

mtexdata forsterite
plotx2east

% plot the Forsterite phase colorized according to orientation
plot(ebsd('fo'),ebsd('fo').orientations)


%%
% When reconstructing grain there are two basic ways how to deal with not
% indexed measurements. The simplest way is to keep the not indexed pixels
% separately, i.e., do not assign them to any indexed grain.

[grains, ebsd.grainId] = calcGrains(ebsd,'angle',5*degree)

%%
% We observe that there are not only grains of specific phases but also not
% indexed grains. Let's add the grain boundaries to the previous plot.

hold on
plot(grains.boundary)
hold off

%%
% The resulting grains contain a lot of holes and one-pixel grains. The
% second way is to assign not indexed pixels to surrounding grains. In MTEX
% this is done if the not indexed data are removed from the measurements,
% i.e.

ebsd = ebsd('indexed') % this removes all not indexed data
[grains, ebsd.grainId] = calcGrains(ebsd,'angle',5*degree)


%%
% Now, there are no not indexed grains computed. Let's visualize the result

% plot the orientation data of the Forsterite phase
plot(ebsd('fo'),ebsd('fo').orientations)

% plot the grain boundary on top of it
hold on
plot(grains.boundary)
hold off

%%
% A more detailed discussion on grain reconstruction in MTEX can be found
% <GrainReconstruction.html here>


%% Smoothing grain boundaries
%
% Due to the measurement grid, the grain boundaries often show a typical
% staircase effect. This effect can be reduced by smoothing the grain
% boundaries. Using the command <grain2d.smooth.html smooth>.

% smooth the grains
grains = smooth(grains);

% plot the orientation data of the Forsterite phase
plot(ebsd('fo'),ebsd('fo').orientations)

% plot the grain boundary on top of it
hold on
plot(grains.boundary)
hold off

%%
% Those grain properties can be used for colorization. E.g. we may colorize
% grains according to their area.

plot(grains,grains.area)

%%
% or a little bit more advanced according to the log quotient between
% grain size and boundary size.

plot(grains,log(grains.grainSize ./ grains.boundarySize))
mtexColorbar

%%
% Note that some properties are available for single phase lists of grains,
% e.g.

% colorize the Forsterite Phase according to its mean orientation
plot(grains('Fo'),grains('Fo').meanOrientation)


%% Changing lists of grains
%
% As with any list in MTEX, one can single out specific grains by conditions
% using the syntax

% this gives all grains with more the 1000 pixels
largeGrains = grains(grains.grainSize > 1000)

hold on
% mark only large Forsterite grains
plot(largeGrains('Fo').boundary,'linewidth',2,'linecolor','k')
hold off
