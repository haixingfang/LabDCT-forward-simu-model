%% *|S2FunHarmonic|*
%
% |S2FunHarmonic| is the heart of |S2Fun|, therefore much effort is put into its functionality.
% This functionality can be best represented if we split the documentation into parts.
%
% <S2FunHarmonic_uni_index.html The first part> covers the features for univariate functions.
% In <S2FunHarmonic_multi_index.html the second part> we consider multivariate functions and generalize the functionality of the first part to higher dimensions.
